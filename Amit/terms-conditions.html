These same are explained here under:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&zwj;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">(i) <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Free-to-play Format (the &ldquo;</em><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Practice Nets</em></strong><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">&rdquo;)</em>: On the FTL app, this format of the Game shall be available under the option shown under the title &lsquo;Practice Nets&rsquo;. In this format, the Users can play the mock Game absolutely free of cost without having to purchase in app Coins by paying real currency on the FTL app. The Game is a simulation where the User upon starting a session will immediately be provided with a fixed amount of units of fictitious cash which can then be used to play on the pretend market on the FTL app by purchasing units of various mock stocks, forex, commodities or crypto currencies as per the User&rsquo;s own analysis of such assets&rsquo; performance on the dummy market. Playing this format would enable the User to test/practice his/her skills. The salient features of this format of the Game are:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No prizes awarded for this format of the Game. Hence, the prize pool as seen in the Play-off League will not be visible to the participating Users in this mode;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The participating Users playing this format will not be able to view the total number of Users participating in that round of the Game on Practice Nets;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Users will not be required to purchase of Coins on the FTL app to play this format. The User can directly start choosing Assets, create the Assets portfolio using the fictitious cash units allocated by FTL and start playing;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game on Practice Nets will begin and end at the time allocated by the FTL admin team and TTPL at their discretion; and<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no limit to the number of Assets or units of those Assets selected by a participating User using the allotted fixed amount of fictitious cash units in the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&zwj;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Pay-to-play Format (the &ldquo;</em><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Play-off League</em></strong><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">&rdquo;)</em>: On the FTL app, this format of the Game is a pay-to-play format available to the User without limits either daily, hourly, fortnightly, monthly or bi-annually where the User, upon selecting this option on the FTL app, is required to redeem a minimum number of virtual coins (the &ldquo;Coins&rdquo;), purchased on the FTL app itself as directed. The User may choose to purchase Coins worth more than the minimum required amount, however, each Play-off League Game shall be played only with a set amount of fictitious cash allotted to each User by the FTL app in the Game and no more. Only that amount of Coins as required to enter the Play-off Game will be redeemable by the User and the User will not be allowed to redeem more than the required number of Coins for a single Play-off Game irrespective of having more than the required number of Coins in his/her wallet. Hence, Users cannot play the Game by purchasing more amount of fictitious cash than that allocated uniformly to every User by the app for a single round of the Game. The User can maintain his/her additionally purchased Coins in his/her wallet on the FTL app, redeeming them accordingly at will to play future Play-off Leagues. Redeeming the minimum required virtual Coins will entitle every participating User with a balance of a certain amount of units of the fictitious cash with which the User can play the Play-off League on the FTL app without limits on a given day, hour, week, month, fortnight or bi-annually. Each Coin purchased by a User on the FTL app will be charged at INR 1 (one rupee) to the User.

The same amount of this fictitious money shall be made available to each participating User in a single Game. As highlighted in Section A above, in the Practice Nets format, the User is not required to purchase Coins while in the Play-off League, Coins will have to be purchased by the User from the FTL app and redeemed accordingly to play each single round of the Play-off League. The User can win prizes for good performance only in the Play-off League. No prizes are awarded to the User in the Practice Nets. However, a leader-board depicting the rank of the User amongst the participating Users in that Game will be calculated by the FTL app in both formats.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">In the Play-off League format the User, redeeming his/her required number of Coins as earlier purchased on the FTL app will join the Play-off League via the home page of the app. The User is then required to create a portfolio of the Assets on offer on the FTL app, which correspond to real assets, forex, commodities or crypto currencies listed in the relevant markets. The User must purchase a minimum number of units of these Assets as required by the Game with the fictitious cash, in order to be considered as a valid participant in the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The Game in both formats will begin at the designated time indicated on the home page for both the formats. The start and end time of the Game shall be decided by TTPL at its own discretion.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Once the Game in either format begins, The FTL app will track the upward or downward movement of these Assets on the relevant markets without limitation on that particular day, hour, week, month, fortnight or bi-annually. Depending on the portfolios created by each User, the FTL app will, at the closure of that League, calculate the average percentage increase or decrease in the overall value of the portfolios created by the Users, which shall be notionally based on the actual performance of such Assets on the relevant market. The calculation and results shall be based on the delayed data received by TTPL from the markets through its third party vendor. Hence, the results on the basis of which the overall ranking of the Users will be determined, shall not be real-time data but a delayed transmission of the publicly available data received from the markets.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The Users depending on their percentage increase or decrease in their Asset portfolio on the app shall be ranked accordingly from the highest to the lowest amongst all the registered Users participating in either format. The participating User whose fictitious portfolio shall record the maximum percentage increase by the end of the League, shall win the Game. The top ranked Users by the end of the Game in the Play-off, shall be eligible to receive cash prizes of varying values as decided on the FTL app depending upon the total number of participants and the prize pool accumulated for that Game. The Users shall be informed of the value of the prizes on the FTL app prior to joining the Play-off League with the prize amount earning of the User decreasing accordingly with a lower rank. The number of participating Users eligible to obtain a prize amount in the Game shall be decided by TTPL prior to the start of the Game and participating Users shall be able to view the same before the Game begins.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The winning Users will be eligible to withdraw their winnings from the FTL app either directly into their bank accounts as earlier registered with FTL&rsquo;s payment service provider or use the entire winnings or any part thereof to purchase further Coins on the FTL app in order to redeem them to join future Play-off Leagues on the app. &nbsp;The total amount of prize money for the Play-off Game, will depend upon the total revenue collected via FTL through the purchase of minimum required number of Coins by all the participating Users entering that Game. From the total amount collected, a major portion of that amount will be utilised towards forming the prize pool of the Play-off League after deducting necessary taxes. Therefore, the size of the overall prize pool for each Play-off League depends automatically on the total number of Users opting to participate in a particular Play-off League and is subject to fluctuate. TTPL has no direct role in fixing the prize amount for any Game on the FTL app. The Users are informed that there are two primary forms of taxes that would be applicable to the payments made through or received from the FTL app i.e. (i) GST and (ii) TDS. As explained in section &lsquo;Q&rsquo; below, while purchasing the Coins on the FTL app, the Users will pay GST in addition to the value of the Coins purchased in each transaction, while during the withdrawal of prize money, TDS as applicable will be deducted from the winnings before the same is transferred into the selected bank account of the User.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">C.1 Trade pages<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">These &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; pages consists of the &lsquo;Markets&rsquo; page and the &lsquo;Watch List&rsquo; page. The contents of both the pages are explained below:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Market Page:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Once on this page, the User will be provided with 3 (three) segregations of performance categories of the Assets which were provided on the FTL app for selection by the Users:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&zwj;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Top Gainers: This category displays all those Assets in descending order, the percentage value of which has increased the maximum on the relevant market in which it is being traded, since the start of the Game. <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Top Losers: This category displays all those Assets in descending order, the percentage value of which has decreased the maximum on the relevant market in which it is being traded, since the start of the Game. <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Top Movers: This category displays all those Assets in descending order, the value of which has seen the maximum amount of movement in terms of overall either percentage increase or decrease on the relevant market in which it is being traded, since the start of the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The Watch List:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Through this page, the User can keep track of the upward or downward movement of his/her favourite/ preferred set of Assets on the relevant market at any point of time during the Game. This would help the User manage his/her portfolio better and provide valuable assistance in decision making of whether to purchase or sell units of such Assets with the fictitious cash in the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The winners in the game will be decided as per a ranking system calculated by the FTL system by analysing the overall net percentage increase in each User&rsquo;s portfolio by the end of the Game and will create a leader-board of rankings in descending order amongst all the Users participating in that particular Game. The Game in the Practice Nets format shall end at the time decided by TTPL and/or the FTL admin team. <br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Search buttons:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The User shall also find a &lsquo;search&rsquo; option on both the &lsquo;Market&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Watch List&rsquo; &nbsp;pages on the FTL app. These are located. The search option button (symbol of magnifying glass) present on the Market page and the Watch List page allows the User to search for any Asset listed on the relevant market on which it is being traded in actuality. The User may type on the search bar under this option to seek out his/her favourite Assets and buy or sell the desired number of units of the same on the FTL app for the purposes of the Game(s).<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">C.2 Portfolio pages<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">These pages consists of the &lsquo;Holdings&rsquo; page and the &lsquo;Orders&rsquo; page. The same are explained below:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Holdings Page<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Having received his/her fictitious cash units, the User may go onto the &lsquo;Holdings&rsquo; page whereupon the User shall receive the current value of the fictitious cash units depending on the performance of the User&rsquo;s Assets on the relevant market as the Game goes on. Further, through the &lsquo;P&amp;L&rsquo; option available on the Holdings page, the User will be able to check the average overall percentage movement of his portfolio on the FTL app during the Game. The remaining amount of fictitious cash units of that User will also be available for checking by the User in terms of current values on the &lsquo;Holdings page&rsquo;.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">When the desired Assets from the allotted fictitious cash units are selected from the list of Assets by the User and his/her portfolio of Assets for the Game is complete, the Holdings page will ask the User to &lsquo;Start Trading&rsquo; and the Game will begin for the User once he/she places his/her first trade.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Orders page<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">The page titled &lsquo;Orders&rsquo; is where the entire purchasing and selling history of the User shall be recorded. Nothing will appear on the Orders page if no Assets are bought by the User in the Game. If the Orders page is empty, then the User can go to the &lsquo;Markets&rsquo; page to purchase fictitious Assets for the purpose of the Game and the history of such transactions will then show up on the Orders page.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">C.3 Leaderboard <br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">By clicking on the &lsquo;Leader board&rsquo; option on the League Page, the User will be able to view his/her current rank in comparison to all other participating Users in the Game at any point of time during the Game. The User will be able to check his/her current rank on the leader board with the difference in portfolio percentage change at all times during the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Selection of the winning Users<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&zwj;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Winners will be decided on the basis of the overall percentage increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio created in the Game by each User participating in the Game. The FTL system shall calculate such percentage increase or decrease in the portfolio value of each participating User from the start to the end of each Game. Accordingly, in descending order of movement in the percentage value of each of the portfolios among participating Users of that particular Game, the FTL system will announce a &lsquo;Leader board&rsquo; containing the final ranks amongst all the participating Users in that Game. The participating User with the highest aggregate percentage increase in his/her portfolio in a particular Play-off League or Practice Net match shall be ranked as &lsquo;Rank No.1&rsquo; on the leader board for that particular Game and so on. The contemplated number of winning Users and the prize amount being won by each such User shall always be displayed on the Game page throughout the duration of the Game. This will only appear in the Play-off League and not in the Practice Nets. The prize amount to be attained by each of the ranked Users shall be displayed prior to the start of the Play-off League to avoid any kind of doubt. <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">In the event of a tie i.e. if by the end of the Game, 2 (two) or more participating Users finish with the exact same percentage increase in their respective portfolios then such Users will be allotted the same rank on the Leaderboard. The prize money allocated to the rank will be distributed equally amongst all the tied Users. TTPL/FTL shall not be liable to pay any prize if it is discovered that the winner(s) have not abided by these ToUs, and other rules and regulations in relation to the use of the FTL app or the Services therein.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">&zwj;<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">C.4 How to Buy/Sell Assets<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Once the User has entered the Markets page, the User will be presented with a number of Assets to choose from to enter them into his Game portfolio of Assets. In order to select a particular Asset to be added to the portfolio, the User must swipe right on that Asset&rsquo;s image, after which it will be automatically added to the portfolio as well as the Watch List. Tapping on the particular Asset tile on the portfolio shall provide the User with an option to either &lsquo;buy&rsquo; or &lsquo;sell&rsquo; desired quantities of the units of that particular Asset. In order to buy more units of a particular selected Asset with the fictitious cash units allocated by FTL to the User at the start of the Game, the User shall &nbsp;set the quantity of the units of that Asset to be bought and shall display the per unit price of that Asset. Upon the desired selections being made by the User, he/she will then be navigated back to the &lsquo;Holdings&rsquo; page where the current value of the User&rsquo;s portfolio as per the data being received from the relevant markets will be provided. The User may note that only the Assets purchased (through the fictitious Game cash) by the User can be sold and that too only limited to the unit quantity that was bought or lesser. The units of these selected Assets will be sold in the same manner as they were bought in the Game.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Purchase of Coins<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">As stated previously, Coins are the products being sold by FTL for a price to its Users since it is the only virtual article using which a User can enter a Play-off League on the FTL app. FTL does not offer any other purchasable Product to its Users on the FTL app apart from these virtual Coins. The User is required to purchase at least a minimum number of these virtual Coins on the FTL app itself in order to play. These Coins can be purchased by a User nowhere else other than on the FTL app and can be redeemed only to enter the Play-offs and for no other purpose either on the FTL app or anywhere else. The User will see a &lsquo;Buy Coins&rsquo; option on the &lsquo;Wallets&rsquo; page of the app. The User can purchase Coins through the wallet or through direct payment via bank transaction etc. Once the &lsquo;Buy Coins&rsquo; button is clicked, the User will be directed towards the payment gateway page to buy and add to the coin balance. For redeeming Coins, the User can do so by entering the &lsquo;Your Winnings&rsquo; page.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Redeeming these minimum number of virtual Coins on the FTL application will earn the User a balance of a set amount of units of fictitious cash, with which the User can play the Play-off League. There is no limit to the number of Coins which a User can purchase in a single sitting on the FTL app, however, the User can only redeem those amount of Coins, as required by FTL to be spent as an &lsquo;entry fee&rsquo; to play one Play-off League and no more at a single time. All Coins purchased via the FTL app must be redeemed and utilised by the User on the FTL app within a period of 1 (one) year from the date of purchase of the Coins, else they will stand forfeited. No monetary currency spent on the FTL app is refundable back to the User by FTL or TTPL, even if a balance of Coins remain present in the User&rsquo;s wallet at the time the User permanently ceases the use of the FTL app or any of the Services or the User&rsquo;s access to the same is suspended or terminated by the FTL admin team for any reason whatsoever. TTPL shall have sole discretion on providing refund of cash to any User. However, the same may only be done under exceptional circumstances.</strong></p>
